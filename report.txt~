IMPORTANT:
in order to run the program, please install the following python libs:
Tkinter, PIL
Sometimes a re-install of PIL is required
software tested on ubuntu 14.04 and windows 10

AFTER INSTALLING THE REQUIRED LIBS, RUN THE PROGRAM WITH

python ready.py

THIS WILL OPEN A GUI WITH A CHESSBOARD
the HUMAN moves first(white)





1. methodology:

we get all the neighbours, remove the ones which put the king in check
we perform minimax using the algorithm in the book (2 steps)

the heuristic I decided to use is based on
a) the values of the pieces
b) the positions of the piece

both the values and the specific positions can be found on this site:
http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Simplified+evaluation+function

2. TIPS
a)the program will end automatically when one of the kings is in a check mate
b) please use the console to track the minimax values of every move
c) the console will also output the time taken for each move
